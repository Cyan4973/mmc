Novel algorithm for fast longest match search.
Primarily designed for compression softwares.

MMC has been tested in combination with [LZ4HC](http://code.google.com/p/lz4hc/) and [zhuff](http://fastcompression.blogspot.fr/p/zhuff.html) compression algorithms.

The algorithm is described on its homepage :
