MMC stands for Morphing Match Chain.

It's an algorithm for fast longest match search (primarily useful for compression softwares)

MMC has been tested in combination with LZ4HC and zhuff compression algorithms.

The algorithm is described on its homepage : http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/p/mmc-morphing-match-chain.html
